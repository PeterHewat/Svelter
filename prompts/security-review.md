# Security Review

Analyze this code for security vulnerabilities:

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Verify proper Clerk + Convex JWT integration and access controls
- **Data Validation**: Ensure all inputs are validated using Convex schema validation
- **XSS Prevention**: Check for potential Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities
- **CSRF Protection**: Verify protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery
- **SQL Injection**: Review database queries for injection vulnerabilities
- **Secrets Management**: Ensure no secrets are exposed in client-side code
- **HTTPS**: Verify all communications use secure protocols
- **Content Security Policy**: Review CSP headers and implementation (see below)
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Ensure errors don't leak sensitive information

Frontend-specific security concerns:

- Sanitize user inputs before rendering
- Validate data from API responses
- Implement proper logout and session handling
- Secure localStorage/sessionStorage usage
- Protect against clickjacking with frame options

Backend/Convex security:

- Proper input validation in mutations and actions
- Correct use of internalQuery/internalMutation
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Secure environment variable handling
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## CSP and response headers (this template)

Production headers are committed in Vercel config — not set by Vite in dev.

| Surface   | File                                                     |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web       | `apps/web/vercel.json` → `headers` (CSP includes Convex) |
| Marketing | `apps/marketing/vercel.json` → `headers` (no CSP)        |

When reviewing or changing CSP:

- Ensure `connect-src` / `wss:` include your Convex deployment URL
- Add any third-party auth or analytics domains you introduce
- Confirm no secrets in client bundles (`loadWebEnv` / `PUBLIC_*` only)
- Verify on a deployed environment: DevTools → Network → document response headers
- Do not mirror production CSP in local Vite dev without a separate dev policy (HMR needs relaxed `script-src`)

Provide specific recommendations:

- Code changes needed to address vulnerabilities
- Security testing strategies
- Monitoring and detection mechanisms
