# Architecture Decision

Help make an informed architectural decision:

- **Context**: What problem are we trying to solve?
- **Requirements**: What are the functional and non-functional requirements?
- **Constraints**: Technical, business, or resource limitations to consider
- **Options Analysis**: Evaluate different approaches with pros/cons
- **Trade-offs**: Understand the implications of each choice
- **Future Impact**: How will this decision affect future development?
- **Team Impact**: How will this affect developer experience and productivity?
- **Performance Impact**: Effects on application performance and scalability
- **Maintenance**: Long-term maintenance and evolution considerations

Consider our tech stack constraints:

- Svelte 5 / SvelteKit ecosystem and patterns
- Convex backend limitations and capabilities
- Clerk + Convex JWT integration
- Tailwind design system
- Monorepo structure with Vitest/Playwright testing

Decision framework:

1. **Define the problem clearly**
2. **List possible solutions**
3. **Evaluate each option against our criteria**
4. **Recommend the best approach with rationale**
5. **Identify risks and mitigation strategies**
6. **Plan implementation steps**
7. **Define success metrics**

Output should include:

- Clear recommendation with reasoning
- Implementation plan with milestones
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Documentation requirements (update `docs/adr/`)
- Team communication plan
- Rollback strategy if needed
