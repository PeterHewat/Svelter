# Dependency overrides

Root [package.json](../package.json) `overrides` pin **transitive** dependency versions for security fixes. Run `bun run audit` after changing them. **Keep the version column in this table aligned with `package.json` on every override change.**

| Package             | Override   | Reason                                                                                                                 |

Re-add an override only when `bun audit` reports a vulnerable range and upstream has not released a fix.

**`ajv`:** No global override. ESLint 10 requires ajv 6 (`json-schema-draft-04`); forcing ajv 8.x breaks `bun run lint`. Bun applies overrides tree-wide (no per-package scoping). [GHSA-2g4f-4pwh-qvx6](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2g4f-4pwh-qvx6) is **moderate** and only affects the `$data` option; ESLint’s ajv 6.14+ includes the backport. `bun run audit` uses `--audit-level=high` (same as CI) so this advisory does not fail the gate.
