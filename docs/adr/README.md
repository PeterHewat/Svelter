# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

> This folder contains Architecture Decision Records - documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are short text documents that capture a decision, including:

- **Context**: What situation led to this decision?
- **Decision**: What did we decide?
- **Status**: Proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded
- **Consequences**: What are the positive/negative outcomes?

## Template for New ADRs

Copy this template when creating new ADR files (name them `001-decision-title.md`, `002-next-decision.md`, etc.):

```markdown
# ADR-001: [Title of Decision]

## Decision
